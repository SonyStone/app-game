### `FlashSubmission`

The outcome of a call made without the client runtime, as it rides the
flash cookie: what was submitted, where, and what came back. `result` and
`error` are mutually exclusive — a thrown outcome fills `error`, a
returned one fills `result` — mirroring the split a scripted call sees.

```ts
interface FlashSubmission {
	input: any[];
	url: string;
	result?: any;
	error?: any;
	truncated?: boolean;
}
```

#### `input`

* **Type:** `any[]`

The arguments the call was made with (files are dropped).

#### `url`

* **Type:** `string`

The call's url: the unbound function base — the server function
request's pathname (`<endpoint>/<id>`), without the `?args=` query a
`.with()`-bound form's action carries (or any other query decoration).
Matches what the scripted road records as a submission's url, so
integrations can match flash and scripted submissions with the same
`s.url === fn.base` test; bound arguments arrive in `input` instead,
prepended exactly like a scripted call's.

#### `result`

* **Type:** `any`

The returned value, when the call returned.

#### `error`

* **Type:** `any`

The thrown value, when the call threw.

#### `truncated`

* **Type:** `boolean`

Set when the outcome was too large for the cookie's 4 KB ceiling and
was degraded to fit (#3137): the input echo is dropped, and `result` /
`error` may carry a bounded prefix — or the bare outcome flag `true` —
rather than the full value. The submission still says what happened
and where; integrations should render it as "succeeded (result too
large to display)" rather than replaying the value.

### `NoJSHandlerOptions`

Options for `createNoJSHandler`.

```ts
interface NoJSHandlerOptions {
	base?: string;
}
```

#### `base`

* **Type:** `string`

The app's mount path, for resolving a relative redirect `Location`.
